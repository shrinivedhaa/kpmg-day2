Problem Statement:

Design and implement a Java Program utilizing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to demonstrate inheritance, abstraction, and method overriding. The program should consist of the following structure:

Person Class (Parent Class):

Contains common attributes such as name, age, and gender.
Includes an abstract method displayDetails() for displaying details about the person.
Employee Class (Child of Person):

Inherits from Person and adds attributes like employeeId and basicSalary.
Implements the displayDetails() method to display personal and employee-specific information.
Contains an abstract method calculateSalary(), which calculates the salary of an employee.
Manager Class (Child of Employee):

Inherits from Employee and adds attributes such as department and bonus.
Implements the calculateSalary() method to calculate the total salary as the sum of basicSalary and bonus.
Overrides the displayDetails() method to include manager-specific information.
Additional Requirements:

Create a test class to demonstrate the functionality of the program.
Allow the user to input data for a Manager object and display their details and total salary.
Include validations such as checking if age is a positive number and ensuring bonus is non-negative.
Engagement for Students:

Add a feature to store multiple Manager and Employee objects in an array or list and display all their details.
Include a sorting feature to sort employees/managers by their salary in descending order.
Encourage creativity by allowing students to add new attributes or features, such as tracking performance ratings or projects handled by managers.
This program aims to strengthen students' understanding of OOP concepts like inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism while fostering problem-solving skills.

Problem Statement:

Design a program to calculate Simple Interest and determine the number of years required for the interest to equal the principal amount. The program should:

Accept inputs from the user, including the principal amount, rate of interest, and time period in years.
Calculate the Simple Interest using the formula:
Simple Interest
=
Principal
×
Rate
×
Time
100
Simple Interest= 
100
Principal×Rate×Time
​
 
Determine the minimum number of years required for the total interest to become equal to or exceed the principal amount.
Display the results, including the calculated interest and the time taken to meet the condition.
The program should handle invalid inputs gracefully and guide the user to input appropriate values.
